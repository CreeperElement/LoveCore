# LoveCore
Even though the name suggests that it's ONLY the core of the project, this is the "full game." Once we know what to call the project as a whole, we'll call it LoveCore.  Most of the core should probably be discussed as a group to decide on how we want to implement menus and other over arcing game design.  However, implementing your own minigames is something that you can do at any time!
